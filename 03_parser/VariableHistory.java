/**
 * This code is an example of the implementation of the HistoryView class. It also shows how each class should have its own function. If I had the
 * VariableHistoryRow class inside this class instead of in a separate class, I think that this class would be trying to keep track of too much. Also, by
 * introducing modularity, these pieces of code can easily be reused in different places.
 */

/**
 * The VariableHistory class displays all the defined variables so far. There also an interactive component in which the user can edit the value of
 * a defined variable.
 *
 * Purpose: To give the user a visual on all the defined variables. Whenever a variable value is updated, it is also reflected in ListView.
 *
 * Assumptions: That every variable defined will have a String representation.
 *
 * Dependencies: ObservableMap<String, String>, ListView, VariableHistoryRow
 *
 * Example: Create an ObservableMap of String keys and values. Use that to create a VariableHistory object. Now, when a new variable is created,
 *          the String name of the variable is saved as a key and the String representation of the variable value is saved as a value. This entry is
 *          added to the ObservableMap internally, and then user sees a new row with the variable name followed by its value, which is also followed
 *          by a TextField and a "Enter" button so that the user can interactively change the value of the variables.
 *          For example, let's say "make :a 10" was entered. A new row appears, the contents of the row being ":a 10 *TextField* *Enter Button*".
 *          If the user then typed in "20" into this TextField and pressed "Enter," then the value of the variable and its display would change instantly
 *          so that the row now showed ":a 20 *TextField* *Enter Button*".
 *          If the user typed "make :a 30" into the command line, the same row would be updated to show ":a 30 *TextField* *Enter Button*"
