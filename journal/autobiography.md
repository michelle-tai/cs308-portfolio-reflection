# CompSci Autobiography
### NAME: Michelle Tai (mrt36)


#### First Computing Experience
I first started using a personal computer/desktop computer when I was around 7-10 years old. I remember having 
to insert CDs into the laptops so that I could do my Chinese school homework, which involved clicking the correct
Chinese characters to shoot a basketball into a basket. I also remember using Google chats to chat with elementary 
school friends, playing Club Penguin and Webkinz on the computer, and watching YouTube videos. Ah... those were 
the golden days...


#### Why Study CompSci
I've always loved the sciences, so before coming to college, I was set on studying some type of cross between 
engineering and biology. I originally chose this path because I loved building things, and I was really interested
in biology. I only took very basic computer science courses in high school and was not the biggest fan of them. 
However, after entering college, I took more computer science courses with the thought of "why not," and I quickly 
realized that computer science and software engineering were fields that I could "build" things in too. Seeing that 
projects were easier to get off the ground due to the ubiquity of technology, I started wanting to learn more about
how technology works. In essence, technology is all around us, and I want to be able to understand it to build cool 
things. In the future, I really want to use computer science to help animals. 

#### My Daily Experiences
I typically use computers to calculate things (calculator is a computer!), to check emails, to figure out what I want to
do with my life, to watch videos, use social media, etc. I sometimes "program" when maintaining my sorority's 
website, when I'm at hackathons, or when I'm following tutorials or DOING LEETCODE :'(

#### Best (or Worst) Programming Experience
My worst programming experience is doing technical interviews. It sucked because I always feel like I don't know how to 
solve the problem at hand, and it frustrates me to not understand things. 

#### Most (or Least) Favorite Programming Project
I don't have one since I don't have many programming projects, but I liked making websites for my previous VMS class. 
Hopefully, I'll experience my favorite programming project in this class!

#### Design Thoughts
I typically write out a general structure of how I want my code to be split on a piece of paper. Then, I write these 
into my program itself as comments to remind myself what subproblems need to be done. I take into consideration the types
of variables I need, what parameters each functions needs, etc. I also try to notice when I'm rewriting code a lot in
order to abstract it and put it into its own function/method. 

#### CompSci 308 Goals
My goals for CompSci 308 is to learn how to actually program things and how to program within a team. I feel like this 
will give me a good feel of how the industry is like, and it might help me decide whether or not I want to pursue
this as a career in the future. Also, I hope to have fun in this class! The projects seem interested, and I'm excited to
collaborate with others to figure out solutions to presented problems. However, I am a little wary as I've heard how hard
this class can be. 

#### Using Programming in the Future
I see myself using programming in the future for potential side projects, to learn front-end web development, and perhaps as
part of my career (if I go into SWE). In the end, I want to be able to find a way to use my skills to help animals, perhaps
by making apps for shelters to promote adoption? I'm not too sure yet.
