## Programming Skills

 * Describe your worst coding experience during this course and what you have learned from it to help prevent it from happening again in future projects.  
 My worst coding experience is either the first game project or the simulation project. For the game
  project, I just had no idea how to create this sort of program–I didn't even know that an object and 
  a class were pretty much the same. Despite hours of trying to make things work, nothing was coming together. 
  I learned that I needed to actually get my hands dirty with trying out code examples, since a lot of what
  I was doing to figure out how to make the breakout program was through only reading or watching tutorials, not
  actually writing any code. To prevent that feeling of confusion and helplessness, I'll definitely be
  keeping a "testing" environment (a spike?) for me to try out snippets of code, and to try to not
  be afraid of failing. This worked out especially well for my parser project, where I did create a spike. 
  It helped me a lot of trying things out for the GUI.   
  For the simulation, the coding experience was bad because I was too scared to actually write any code. 
  I didn't have any confidence in the code I could write, so I wrote very minimal code and spent more of 
  my time pair programming or talking about the design. While I did learn that I did enjoy the planning phase
  more than the implementation, there wasn't any tangible work that could be attributed to me, and I also became
  more of a burden than a help to my teammates. As a result, in the future, I will try to overcome my impostor 
  syndrome better and not be afraid to fail. I need to remind myself that it's normal to fail when learning, 
  and if I don't try, I won't write ANY code, so may as well write something down. 
  
 * Describe your best coding experience or most important thing you learned about coding during this course and what you learned from it.  
  My best coding experience was during the parser project. An amalgam of things made it an amazing experience, from the
  team to the work we did, but I think in this project, I was able to take my previous, bad coding experiences
  and set my mind to improve. The team also harbored a really collaborative atmosphere, so not only was I able
  to actually contribute to the code (and created a spike! and used it!), I actually learned a lot from pair programming. 
  In addition, our team explained how we implemented things, so I was not only able to learn how to code
  through writing my own part of the code, but also from hearing how my teammates implemented their parts. 
  This experience taught me that, honestly, your team is pretty integral to the outcome of a project, and
  that being on the same page and communicating a lot will result to success!
  
 * What specific technologies (e.g., GIT, command-line, XML) or skills beyond coding (e.g., designing, debugging, testing, managing) did you find most interesting or develop/discover an aptitude for?
 In the beginning, all the design choices and possible ways to implement things really scared me–I was overwhelmed
 by all the options, which contributed to my lack of code in the beginning. I was scared of designing something
 incorrectly/wrong, and in considering all the ways to design something, I wasn't able to settle on one way
 and implement it. However, as the semester progressed, I started to realize that I enjoy planning out 
 how the program will work and how different parts will interact, so my "overthinking" about everything was 
 also a strength in talking with others about the pros and cons of certain design choices. 


## Teamwork

 * Describe your worst team experience during this course and what you have learned from it to help prevent it from happening again in future projects.
 My worst team experience is this current, final project. Only one teammate has consistently responded to 
 my messages into our groupchat. Also, coming in from finishing the parser project, I was pretty excited
 to continue that sort of wholesome teamwork. However, from the beginning, I saw that a couple of my
 teammates didn't seem to care a lot about the work we were going to do. While we did share that we were 
 all taking the course pass/fail, I didn't expect that to lead to such a lack of communication and work. 
 It was such a stark difference to my previous experience. After trying really hard to make a good plan 
 so that our coding part will be easier, some said that we didn't need to care about the api and how things will
 be implemented since we'll "figure it out when we start." Well, that led to catastrophe we're all in right now. 
 Also, some teammates didn't complete their parts by their deadlines, which bottlenecked the amount of 
 work we could do. This experience has honestly been eye-opening since all the other teams I worked with 
 were really dedicated and willing to meet and talk for however long needed; however, for this last team, 
 they did not have the same sentiment. I honestly think that our years mattered in this scenario (that's the
 tea)–my previous teams were all sophomores, and we were really dedicated to our work compared to the juniors and 
 senior I'm currently working with. I'm honestly not sure why this happened.  
 From this experience, I became really dejected by the end of the first week, and stopped trying to reach out 
 to my team. This, in addition to some personal problems at home, barred me from being able to focus on this
 project. However, I should have kept trying and not gave up. As a result, I would say that I learned that
 not everyone will be as enthusiastic or willing to do work as others, and I need to learn how to work 
 with that and push other to finish their parts. I'm a fairly introverted person, but I need to learn 
 how to be confident and delegate. I also need to keep communicating, even if it feels like no one
 is responding. It's better to try than give up. To prevent this experience from happening again, I won't
 keep my mouth shut when I disagree with the way things are going. If I feel that something isn't going well, 
 like our lack of planning or implementation ideas, I won't stay quiet. I will speak my thoughts so that I 
 won't feel as powerless and confused about how everything's working as I am at this moment. 

 * Describe your best team experience during this course and what you have learned from it to help encourage it to happen again in future projects.  
 My best team experience during this course was working with my parser project team. Everyone was really dedicated and
 responsible, which motivated me to work harder. I should've been that person for my final project team. My team 
 constantly communicated our progress and problems and met often to work. We helped each other out and learned
 from each other through sharing how we designed things to pair programming. Just the responsiveness, enthusiasm, 
 and dedication from each team member is unparalleled. We put our all in, and we were rewarded with a really
 good program. I want to bring this sort of energy to future teams–to communicate a lot with others about
 both my successes and failures, to be willing to learn from other but also teach others, and to care. 

 * What do want your team mates to say is your greatest strength in helping the team and why?  
 I think my teammates would say that my greatest strength in helping the team is communicating 
 and sharing my successes and failures. I think it's kinda ironic since I'm pretty shy, 
 but I really pushed myself to keep my team updated with everything. I constantly texted that group what I got done, bugs I found, 
 some ideas about design I had, or something I was struggling with. I think this helped keep the team 
 in the loop about what I was doing. I also suggested a lot of meetings, which helped us touch base
 and integrate our parts together. As a result, by constantly communicating, I think I also was able to 
 spur the team on in getting their parts done. 


## Personal

 * Think of what you have previously identified as a personal strength. How did this course help to reinforce that belief or help you find new strengths?  
 Before this course, I don't think I really identified anything as a personal strength (that pertains to 
 this course). I've always been fairly critical of myself, so I've never really thought of what I was "good" at. 
 However, thinking a little bit more about it now, what I might have identified as a personal strength would be/was
 my empathy and my commitment to my work. This course has definitely tested me in a lot of different ways, and by putting
 a lot of time and effort into this course, it strengthened my ability to learn without having my hand held. I was 
 really determined to seek out ways to improve, and I think that this course helped me realize that a professor
 won't always give me everything I need to know–I need to seek a lot of information out my own too. This 
 course also helped me find a new strength, which is my communication. I never thought that that would 
 be a particular strength of mine, but in my team feedback, my teammates have said that I was really good
 at communicating. That's partially fueled from my stress, which makes me frantically text about things haha. But 
 I don't think I would have realized this particular strength without this course. 

 * Think of what you have previously identified as a personal weakness. How have you worked to improve upon your weaknesses this semester?  
 A personal weakness I have is my impostor syndrome/my lack of confidence. This was really evident in the 
 beginning of the semester since it made me scared to write code in fear that I would "fail" at it. In a 
 sense, I did "fail" at writing code, but it helped me learn. Throughout the semester, I kept having to remind
 myself to just try my idea out instead of mulling over the details of a particular design. By forcing myself
 to write code, I've been feeling more confident about my abilities, even if I have failed a lot. This course
 helped me be more comfortable with failing and learning. While I'm still a bit of a perfectionist, I'm able
 to have more realistic expectation of myself now and actually be able to do the work needed. 

 * What personal development steps do you want to take to continue to develop your skills after this course?  
 I really want to improve my design and understanding of how parts of code work together. Now that summer 
 is coming soon, I plan on working on smaller programs to test out some of the concepts I've learned in this class. 
 I've also had the goal of remaking a breakout game after my first try was a complete flop. As a result, 
 that would be my first step in improving my understanding of design. I also want to find tutorials and information
 about how Java and is used in the real world and possibly make real world applications!
