Honestly, I just feel really lost and confused. I hope that things will get better, but I just don't know. So much 
is going on, and I'm just afraid for the future. How many more people will have to suffer and die from COVID-19
before things start getting better? How long will we need to live like this? 
Will my internship be cancelled? Will I be able to succeed in my classes?
Will my family be okay? I'm just lost. But at least at home, I have my dog and good food to eat.
