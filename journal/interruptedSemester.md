Honestly, I just feel really lost and confused. I hope that things will get better, but I just don't know. So much 
is going on, and I'm just afraid for the future. How many more people will have to suffer and die from COVID-19
before things start getting better? How long will we need to live like this? 
Will my internship be cancelled? Will I be able to succeed in my classes?
Will my family be okay? I'm just lost. But at least at home, I have my dog and good food to eat.

The acts of racism towards Asian-Americans and Asians have been scaring me too. I'm scared to leave my house sometimes, 
in case someone attacks me because of how I look. It's just so frustrating to see how America is. In Asian-American
communities on campus, we always have taken anti-blackness into account since it's a very real thing, but I feel like
all minorities (and majorities) are just scapegoating Asians for what has happened. Like yes, it did originate from China
and I'm sorry for that, but we're not all like that. We don't have control over what happened there. When Ebola was a thing, 
no one was telling African Americans to "go back where they came from" or called it the "African Virus." White settlers
brought smallpox and infected the Native Americans, but no one seems to talk about that part of history + talk about Caucasians
in a bad light. Why are Asians picked on? Is it because they're seen as submissive? I don't know. I'm just scared for my
family and me and my friends and just everyone because of the state of the USA and the coronavirus.
